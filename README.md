# juce_sparkle 

Add support for updating your JUCE applications. This module uses [WinSparkle](https://winsparkle.org) on Windows and [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org) on macOS to do the heavy lifting. 

The module provides an easy to use cross platform API you can use to update your application. Besides updating this module also contains some utilities to create installers for both Windows and macOS.
